A Streamlit Web App to Predict Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning

# 📋 Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of three diseases:
# 🩸 Diabetes
# ❤️ Heart Disease
# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease
This user-friendly interface allows individuals to input their medical details and get instant predictions. Built with Streamlit, it offers real-time responses and helps with early disease diagnosis.

# 🔮 Prediction Workflow
# 1️⃣ Diabetes Prediction 🩺
Input details like pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, etc.

Prediction Result: Displays whether the person is diabetic or not.
# 2️⃣ Heart Disease Prediction ❤️
Input details such as age, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.

Prediction Result: Indicates whether the person has heart disease.
# 3️⃣ Parkinson’s Disease Prediction 🧠
Provide voice-related measures like MDVP, jitter, shimmer, and other biomedical voice features.

Prediction Result: Identifies the presence of Parkinson’s disease.
# 🛡️ Models Used
Diabetes Prediction Model: Trained on a dataset of medical records using Logistic Regression.
Heart Disease Prediction Model: Developed with Decision Tree Classifier.
Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model: Utilizes SVM (Support Vector Machine) for voice-based feature prediction.
