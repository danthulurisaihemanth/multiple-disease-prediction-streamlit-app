# 🏥 Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Streamlit-app with fastapi deployment
A Streamlit Web App to Predict Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning

# 📋 Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of three diseases:
# 🩸 Diabetes
# ❤️ Heart Disease
# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease
This user-friendly interface allows individuals to input their medical details and get instant predictions. Built with Streamlit, it offers real-time responses and helps with early disease diagnosis.

# 🚀 Features
1.Diabetes Prediction 🩺

2.Heart Disease Prediction ❤️

3.Parkinson's Disease Prediction 🧠

4.Interactive User Interface 🎨

5.Real-time Prediction Results 🔮

# 🛠️ Technology Stack

- 🐍 Programming Language: Python
- 🌐 Web Framework: Streamlit 
- Machine Learning Models: Pickled Models for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease
- 📊 Frontend: Streamlit Widgets and Option Menu 📊
